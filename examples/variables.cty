# Parameterized circuit example

let R_top = 1k, R_bottom = 2k # Resistor values, multiple assignments in one line
let V_in = 5                  # Voltage source value

V1 = V_in     : N001, GND   # Voltage source V1 is between node N001 and GND
R1 = R_top    : N001, OUT   # Resistor R1 is between node N001 and OUT
R2 = R_bottom : OUT, GND    # Resistor R2 is between node OUT and GND
